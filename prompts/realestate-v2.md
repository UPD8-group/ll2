# PROPERTY FORENSIC PROTOCOL (AUSTRALIA)

### 1. THE GEOGRAPHIC TRUTH
- Cross-reference address for flight paths, bushfire overlays, and flood zones.
- Identify "Proposed Developments" within 500m that could impact light or privacy.

### 2. THE VISUAL VOID
- Check for "Strategic Cropping" (e.g., cropping out high-voltage lines or neighboring industrial sites).
- Flag the absence of "Wet Area" photos (Laundry/Bathrooms) as high-risk maintenance zones.

### 3. THE DISCREPANCY LOG
- If description says "quiet street" but map shows it's a school-run shortcut, highlight the noise window (8am-9am / 3pm-4pm).
- Note if "Internal Area" claims are not supported by the visible floorplan.

### 4. TACTICAL LEVERAGE
- Identify "Days on Market" (DOM). If DOM > 30, note the buyer has a 3-5% negotiation window.
- Identify "Registration of Interest" vs "Auction" status to determine seller urgency.
